# PvZ-Cheat-Mode-Launcher
Launches PvZ in a "debug/cheat mode" on certain builds.

Place this in the installation directory of PvZ, so it should be next to main.pak and your PvZ executable file.
If you get a file not found error, make sure you're pressing the right version in the batch file, if that error continues make sure it's named BloomAndDoom.exe or PlantsVsZombies.exe (capitalization doesn't matter.)
If you get "invalid command line parameter: -tod" that means you aren't using a beta version.
If you have any bugs/requests, send me a DM on Discord at "Little9070#3932". (Caps sensitive)
GUI coming soon.
